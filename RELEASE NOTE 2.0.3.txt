1. BUG FIXING
-------------

1.1 Processing

- Modify processing.py to import std_modis_monavg module (The processing services was stopped for UoG/IOC - reported by TPZF).
- Modify loop_eumetcast_ftp() in get_eumetcast, to update 'processed_list' (files copied continuously - found out at ToT Nairobi).
- Do not recompute climatology for MODIS monthly products (std_modis_monavg processing chain).
- In ingestion, do the merge to output files only for 'tile' type (e.g. PML) and work in tmp_dir (rather than output_dir).
- Activate sst-fronts calculation on all dates.
- Make more robust conv_list_2_string() for error check.
- Avoid duplications in 'input_files' metadata tag - for ingestion of 'tile' products.

1.2 Visualization

- Correct GetProductLayer() in webpy_esapp.py to save legend steps as float, rather than int (problem with Chla legend=83 at ToT Nairobi)

1.3 Configuration/DB

- Enable the computation of SST Fronts for MODIS-SST and PML-MODIS-SST
- Define a new Thema ('Training Centres') and associate both Land and Marine Products to it (from ToT Nairobi)

1.4 Other packages

- Correct the Docs.rpm to display the correct French documentation

- Extend SPOTV-IGAD-1km mapset to -12. South, to include Tanzania (required by ICPAC at ToT Nairobi)
