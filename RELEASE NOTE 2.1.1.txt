1. BUG FIXING
-------------

1.1 Acquisition

- LSASAF-LST: correct a bug on ingestion of LSASAF-LST (corrupted .bz2 files block the ingestion service)

- Get Internet: improve the checks in file downloading (manage more HTTP codes - see ES2-67)

1.2 Processing

- Primary Production: correct the algorithm (28.5 Celsius threshold for PbOpt computation - see ES2-49) and check all files present (see ES2-36).
