#   Release Note for 2.0.4
#   Changes with respect to 2.0.3-12 - Unless specification, they refer to Apps.rpm package.
#

1. BUG FIXING
-------------

1.1 Acquisition

- Correct the ingestion of product MPEG-MPEF, which failed - from time to time - resulting in files copied to /data/ingest.wrong (see Tuleap #11144)
- Modify the eumetcast source description for MODIS Chla product from EUMETCast and ingest pre-processing type, following change from .hdf to .nc format (see Tuleap #10903)

1.2 Processing

- Modify existing processing chains (lsasaf_et and _lst) to: 1. Save file checkpoints to a separate .sqlite and 2. change checksum_level = 0.
  This is to avoid re-computations at every run.

1.3 DataManagement

- Creation of archives from request (see Tuleap #11146): 1. a separate file (_0001.bsx) is created for each sub-products (before the same file was overwritten)
  2. The file decompress.sh is added under apps/productmangement/installer

1.4 Visualization

- For visualizing correctly Chla legends, define explicitly the decimal separator type in webpy_esapp:GetProductLayer() - see Tuleap #10904

1.5 Service

- Correct the DB dump in the System Service (see Tuleap #10905)

1.6 Configuration/DB


1.7 Packages (pre-post inst)
