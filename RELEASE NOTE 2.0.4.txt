#   Release Note for 2.0.4
#   Changes with respect to 2.0.3-12 - Unless specification, they refer to Apps.rpm package.
#

1. BUG FIXING
-------------

1.1 Acquisition/Processing/DataManagement

- Creation of archives from request: 1. a separate file (_0001.bsx) is created for each sub-products (before the same file was overwritten)
  2. A directory can be passed to create_archive_from_request.py, so to iterate on all '.req' files contained.

- Modify existing processing chains (lsasaf_et and _lst) to: 1. Save file checkpoints to a separate .sqlite and 2. change checksum_level = 0.
  This is to avoid re-computations at every run.

2. NEW FEATURES
---------------

2.0

- Modifications to manage a 'proxy': 1. Define functions._proxy_defined() to read definition from factory_settings.ini

- Changes of get_internet: 1. In case of proxy, change the parsing of ftp-response. 2. Re-organize/rename/clean functions' naming.
  3. Implement the management of type=http (similar to ftp, but for http servers)
